<h1>Creating a website for School</h1>
<p>A website for the School will need to have several tags, tables and links to be able to meet the requirements. The wants for the school is to be able to view current assignment due dates, Dates for the exams, Timetables, view schedules, and syllabuses. </p>

Some of the tags and classes that may be used for the website are:

Title, 
style, 
height, 
width, 
alt, hover, px, font-family, font-size, word-spacing, letter-spacing, table, background-color, border-color, border-width, span, and etc.

For most of these we would simply add a : to then give the value for the tag, title, length, color, and etc.
